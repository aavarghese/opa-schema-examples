A reference of type ImageStreamTag, ImageStreamImage or DockerImage may be used. A pull secret can be specified to pull the image from an external registry or override the default service account secret if pulling from the internal registry. Image sources can either be used to extract content from an image and place it into the build context along with the repository source, or used directly during a multi-stage container image build to allow content to be copied without overwriting the contents of the repository source (see the 'paths' and 'as' fields).",
